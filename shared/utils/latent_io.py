"""Thin companion-file format for WanGP generated latents.

A companion ``.pt`` file stores the final pre-decode latent(s) per generated
media file, tagged with the identity of the app/model/VAE that produced them,
so the latent can later be decoded or reused as the starting point of a new
generation. The file is a flat, tagged dictionary: the top-level
object carries one entry per format id, so each model family can later attach
its own interpretation to new keys without bumping the format version.

Entry formats:

- ``wgp_latent/1`` (the all-latent layout): the video latents of
  every window of the job stacked on the latent time dimension, with one
  metadata block per window in video order (the per-window prompt, seed,
  steps and denoising strength, the pixel-space head/tail trims and the
  decoded frame count). The entry records the VAE identity (file name,
  SHA-256, dtype, latent channels), the canvas (width, height, fps, HDR
  flag + transform) and the sidecar's total committed frame count, so the
  decoded length is known without re-deriving it from the VAE layout. The
  sidecar is the sole content source of its video: the only non-latent block
  in the whole format is, on i2v sidecars only, the start image embedded as
  lossless PNG bytes (the preprocessed canvas-size frame the production
  assembly splices into frame 0). Decoding the window latents, re-applying
  the recorded trims and splicing the embedded image (i2v) reproduces the
  original video exactly. It is the layout the app writes for every
  latent-writing job — LTX2 was the first family to write it, then Wan,
  LongCat and MiniMax H3 (the H3 VAE's piecewise 5/17 temporal layout
  rides with the window blocks instead of the linear
  ``latent_stride``/``frame_offset`` fields). It is the only video layout
  the app writes or reads: a ``wgp_latent/1`` entry without a ``windows``
  list is not a current file, and the decode and branch flows refuse such
  files with the one generic message (:func:`non_current_latent_message`).
- ``wgp_latent/audio/1``: the pre-decode audio latent(s) of models that
  generate audio, stored with the same per-window stacking as the video
  windows (one block per window, aligned with the video windows). The audio
  entry is all-latent: it carries the audio VAE identity and the vocoder
  name, never a pointer to an external audio source.

Video entries may additionally record the VAE's temporal layout
(``latent_stride``/``frame_offset``, so the pixel frame count can be derived
for any VAE, not only Wan's) and the HDR state of the decoded output
(``is_hdr``/``hdr_transform``).

MiniMax H3's video VAE has a piecewise temporal layout (the first two latent
frames cover five pixel frames, then every five latent frames cover a
17-frame clip) that the linear ``offset + stride * (t - 1)`` model cannot
express, so H3 entries carry explicit per-window metadata instead:
``frame_count`` (the window's output frame count), ``h3_history_frames``
(the input frames the window's generation was conditioned on; the decode
job re-decodes them from the previous window in front of the window's
target run and the recorded head trim drops them again, so they never
count in the window's own committed share), ``h3_target_frames`` (the
pixel length the decoded window is truncated to) and ``h3_anchor_head``
(1 when the window's first decoded frame is a re-anchored shared frame —
the last decoded frame of the window it continues — which the head trim
drops from its contribution, or commits as its first frame when the
window carries a one-frame head share). The helper
:func:`h3_video_latent_pixel_frames` derives the decoded pixel length
from the latent time dimension.

Only ``torch`` and the Python standard library are required. When NumPy is
available it is used for the raw-bytes conversion; otherwise the latent is
stored through torch's native (already zlib-compressed) tensor serialization.

    ``frame`` is a 1-based count of final-video frames to keep ("keep this
    many frames"; the last frame when 0/empty, counted from the end when
    negative — the same semantics as the *Truncate* field). A cut can never
    fall inside a latent frame, so the resolved cut lands on a latent
    boundary; which side of the picked frame it lands on depends on the mode:

    - the default (``fit=False``) takes the pick as the branch point: the
      cut lands on the boundary *before* the latent that contains the frame,
      so that whole latent — the branch's first new latent — is regenerated
      in the new video, and every frame of it changes up to the previous
      latent;
    - ``fit=True`` (the *Round branch frame up to a latent boundary*
      checkbox) keeps the latent containing the frame unchanged and advances
      the cut to the boundary *after* it, clamping forward (a window preset,
      the frame exactly at a window's committed end, clamps to that window's
      last boundary).

    A pick that falls exactly on a latent boundary (including a window's
    committed end) is its own cut in both modes. The final video the Latent
    Decode job assembles concatenates each window's head-/tail-trimmed
    decoded run in window order (see :func:`_window_committed_offsets`), so
    the picked frame's position inside its window's decoded run is
    ``head_trim + (frame - offset)``; a pick whose last kept frame still
    sits before the window's committed start (a head-trimmed window's
    committed range can start inside its first decodable prefix) cannot be
    its own cut, and the default falls back to the ``fit`` resolution
    whenever the previous boundary does not exist or falls before the first
    frame of the video.

    Returns ``None`` when the frame falls outside the sidecar's recorded
    range (before the first committed frame, past the last one, or no
    readable windows) or the entry is not a current all-latent file.
    Otherwise a dict with:

    - ``window_no``: the (1-based) window containing the picked frame;

      of the resolved cut;
    - ``kept_frames``: the resolved cut (the branch point itself, 1-based in
      the final video);
    - ``decoded_prefix``: the pixel length the cut decodes to inside its
      window (the new head window's head trim derives from it);
    - ``total_frames``: the sidecar's total committed frame count;
    - ``overrun``: ``kept_frames - total_frames`` when the cut passes the
      last committed frame (possible only in the last window, whose tail
      trim can leave a gap between the last latent boundary and the video
      end); 0 otherwise;
    - ``fit``: whether the resolved cut is the rounded (fit) one — true when
      it is requested or when the default fell back to it (false for an
      on-boundary pick and for the mid-latent default);
    - ``mid_latent``: whether the mid-latent default resolution applied,

    generated window) the sidecar carries the containing window ``K``'s
    video as the capped cut block (see :func:`branch_cut_window_block`);
    this is its audio companion: the window's own pre-decode audio latents
    sliced at the resolved cut (the same time-ratio splice the frozen
    audio prefix uses), so the new sidecar's audio entry is self-contained
    the way its video entry is. The PDD fallback is the live case: the
    rejected prefix never freezes the window's audio (the fresh head
    window generates its own), and without this block the sidecar's audio
    entry skips the kept region, whose decode is silence (or a track
    shifted by one window).

    The slice keeps the sidecar's stored layout (``[c, count * mel]`` for
    the mel families, ``[64, count]`` for MiniMax H3); ``samples`` records
    the slice's share of the window's recorded sample count (its duration

    when it is the window's committed tail (the kept region sits at the
    same timeline position in the branch as in the source). The block
    carries no window number of its own: the destination builder numbers
    it positionally, like the carried windows.

    ``sidecar_obj`` is the loaded source sidecar (its
    ``wgp_latent/1`` and ``wgp_latent/audio/1`` entries) and

    """The branch-shaped head window for a sidecar's containing window.

    A branch job's head window is the containing window ``K`` of the
    resolved branch point, regenerated from the cut: its denoised tensor
    is ``[the kept latents of K (verbatim from the sidecar) | new
    latents]``. With the cut inside ``K`` (the mid-latent default, or the
    rounded resolution clamping to a boundary strictly inside ``K``) the
    new latents complete ``K`` up to its committed end, so the window's
    geometry (decoded length, committed range) matches ``K``'s own; with
    the cut at ``K``'s committed end the head window's new portion is a
    fresh standard window (the caller supplies its geometry) and the
    prefix is ``K``'s full latent run.

    ``requested_new_frames`` is the new segment the user asked for (the
    job's video length, which excludes the verbatim kept prefix).

    For linear layouts (Wan/LongCat 4/1, LTX2 8/1) the head window
    shrinks to fit a short request: its ``frame_num`` is the decoded
    prefix plus the request rounded up to the VAE's latent multiple.
    MiniMax H3 keeps ``K``'s own geometry instead — the clip-anchored
    transformer needs the identical clip layout ``K`` was generated with,
    and a window never falls below the H3 minimum of 124 frames:
    ``frame_num`` is ``K``'s recorded ``frame_count`` (on the 5+17k grid),
    the new latents run to ``K``'s last latent, the committed new portion
    is the request clamped to the cut's committed tail, and the overshoot
    is absorbed as ``tail_trim_new`` (which also re-applies ``K``'s own
    tail trim, the new block decoding at ``K``'s capped length).

    Returns a dict with ``prefix_latents`` (the kept latents' count in
    window ``K``, always a self-contained first ``P`` latents run so the
    new sidecar decodes cleanly), ``decoded_prefix`` (the pixel frames
    those latents decode to, the head trim of the branch job's window 1),
    the containing window's full ``latent_count``/``decoded_window``/
    ``start_frame``/``head_trim``/``tail_trim`` metadata, ``first_new_frame``
    (the 0-based index of the first regenerated frame), ``natural_new``
    (the new frames from the cut to ``K``'s committed end), ``committed_start``
    / ``committed_end`` (the containing window's committed range in the final
    video, as 0-based committed-frame counts, the end exclusive) and, when the
    cut is inside ``K``, ``frame_num``/``new_frames``/``tail_trim_new`` for the

    """The branch head window plan for an all-latent MiniMax H3 sidecar.

    A pure function over the sidecar's window blocks: given the sidecar
    entry and a resolved branch point (a :func:`branch_point_for_frame`
    result) it returns the geometry the branch job's head window needs.
    It never touches the source video, never loads a model, and never
    mutates its inputs, so the same branch point plans identically from
    any copy of the sidecar — every length the H3 branch flow uses (the
    overlap, the guide, the anchor flag) comes from the plan itself.

    Every length routes through the decode job's own arithmetic
    (:func:`_window_decoded_frames`, :func:`_window_committed_frames`,
    :func:`_window_committed_offsets`), so the branch plan and the
    decode cannot drift: the kept decoded length is capped at the
    containing window's committed end (its capped decoded run minus its
    tail trim, in the window's decoded-run coordinates); ``kept_decoded``
    is that region's length in final-video terms (the cut's committed
    share of the containing window, its full committed run in case B);
    and ``assembly_overlap`` is the prefix of the head window's decoded
    output the assembly drops (also the head trim the branch sidecar
    records on the head window, so the decode reassembles the same
    video the job wrote): in case A the kept latents' decoded length
    (capped at the committed end), in case B the committed kept region
    itself.

    The case follows the cut: inside the containing window's committed
    range it is ``"A"`` — the head window is that window itself,
    regenerated from the cut with the kept latents frozen at its head,
    the new latents completing it up to its last latent, the committed
    new portion the request clamped to the cut's committed tail, and the
    overshoot absorbed as the new block's tail trim; at the window's
    committed end it is ``"B"`` — a fresh window whose kept portion is
    the containing window's full latent run (its geometry comes from
    the job's standard first-window plan), which ``anchor_head`` marks
    as the GAP-3 anchor-head window when the end is cap-driven (the
    recorded ``h3_target_frames`` below the natural decoded length):
    the pure-new window whose first decoded frame re-anchors the
    carried window's last frame.

    ``anchor_head`` / ``clean_window_end`` (the Case B restriction the

    ``latent_count``, ``new_latents``, ``decoded_prefix`` /

    the cut — case A: shorter than the kept decoded run by the window's
    head share for a second-and-later window), ``assembly_overlap``,
