[ti:Pull Me Under]
[ar:ProducerAi]
[length:03:54.05]
[00:06.68]Shadows gather on my table
[00:10.40]Her stare on me, wild and quiet
[00:15.60]A hush before surrender
[00:19.31]Glass glints, the storm inside
[00:32.69]Heavy velvet settles in this room
[00:38.63]Underneath her gaze, intentions loom
[00:43.09]Fingers dancing slow on crystal stem
[00:47.55]Losing track of when control began
[00:52.01]She leans forward, time dissolves
[00:54.98]Drifting close until all that’s left is her resolve
[01:03.15]It’s darker with her laughter near
[01:08.35]No warning on this slide
[01:15.78]Pull me under, no leaving now
[01:22.47]Taste that danger, show me how
[01:30.65]Captive in her shadow, tangled by design
[01:38.82]If this is ruin, let ruin be divine
[01:52.19]Room’s a fever, heartbeat caught
[01:55.91]She turns thunder into thoughts
[01:59.62]Desire flickers like a match
[02:04.08]Craving what I can’t detach
[02:08.54](pause—rain/whisper)
[02:12.26]You’re the sound I can’t outrun
[02:14.48](pause—sudden alto sax riff)
[02:15.97]Her secrets hum electric wires
[02:20.43]All my reasons quit the fight
[02:27.86]Pull me under, no safe ground
[02:34.55]Willing prisoner, wrapped around
[02:42.72]Beautiful captivity, in her hands I spin
[02:51.64]Let me fall where the wildness begins
[02:59.81]In this surrender I’m made whole
[03:04.27](whisper: let the bruises paint my soul)
[03:07.98]Pull me under, and I stay drowned
[03:15.41]Lost in you, I never want out
[03:23.59]Captive in darkness, give in, don’t pretend
[03:31.76]You are beginning, you are every end
[03:39.93]Pull me under
[03:42.91](Pull me under)
[03:48.11]No looking back now
