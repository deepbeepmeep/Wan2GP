[00:04.00] A high-rise apartment at night, rain streaking down the large window. Inside, shadows are long and deep. The room is modern, minimalist, yet feels heavy with unspoken things. [Camera: Static wide shot, establishing the scene's mood]
[00:09.00] In the apartment, the man sits at a dark wood table, a glass of whiskey untouched. Across from him, the woman's stare is a physical presence, her expression unreadable, intense. The city lights blur into a bokeh background behind her. [Camera: Medium shot, focused on the man, with the woman's intense gaze in the foreground, rack focus]
[00:15.00] A close-up on the woman's hand, her fingers with black nail polish tracing the rim of her wine glass. The movement is slow, deliberate, captivating. [Camera: Macro shot, shallow depth of field]
[00:21.00] The man's reflection is caught in the polished surface of the dark table, distorted and fragmented. He looks up, his eyes meeting hers, a silent challenge passing between them. [Camera: Low angle shot, looking up from the table surface]
[00:28.00] The woman leans forward slightly, a subtle shift that changes the energy in the room entirely. The air thickens, charged with electricity. Her lips part as if she's about to speak, but she says nothing. [Camera: Slow push-in, focusing on the woman's face]
[00:35.00] An underground club, strobing lights cutting through manufactured fog. Bodies move to a heavy beat. The woman leads the man through the crowd, her grip firm on his hand. [Camera: Handheld, dynamic, following them through the club]
[00:42.00] In a secluded booth in the club, the woman's laughter is a low, dangerous sound. She leans close to the man, her silhouette framed by a red neon sign behind her. [Camera: Close-up on their faces, intimate, with neon backlighting]
[00:49.00] The man watches her, completely captivated. The rest of the club fades into a blur of motion and color. He is in her orbit, and nothing else matters. [Camera: Point of view shot from the man's perspective]
[00:56.00] A rain-slicked alleyway behind the club. The brick walls are dark and wet. The woman has the man pinned against the wall, not with force, but with her intense presence. The scene is both threatening and deeply intimate. [Camera: Medium two-shot, slightly canted angle]
[01:03.00] Close up on their faces in the alley. Raindrops cling to their hair and skin. Her expression is one of dark, possessive triumph. His is a mixture of shock and surrender. [Camera: Extreme close-up, capturing the raw emotion]
[01:10.00] The man's hand comes up to cup her face, his thumb stroking her cheek. A moment of vulnerability in the gritty urban landscape. [Camera: Detail shot, focusing on the hands and faces]
[01:17.00] She kisses him, a devouring, passionate kiss that's more about claiming than affection. The city sounds—a distant siren, the hum of electricity—fade into the background. [Camera: Orbiting shot, circling them slowly]
[01:24.00] Back in the high-rise apartment, the room is a mess of discarded clothes and overturned glasses. The mood is feverish, the aftermath of a storm. [Camera: Wide shot, showing the chaotic intimacy of the space]
[01:31.00] The woman stands by the window, looking out at the sprawling city lights. Her silhouette is sharp, powerful. She is a force of nature against the urban backdrop. [Camera: Low angle shot from the floor, making her look dominant]
[01:38.00] The man is in bed, watching her. His expression is one of awe and a little fear. He is completely undone by her. [Camera: Over-the-shoulder shot from behind the man]
[01:45.00] A sudden, aggressive alto sax riff plays. The visual is a rapid montage: strobing club lights, rain on glass, a flash of her dark lipstick, the man's clenched fist. [Camera: Fast cuts, rhythmic, matching the music]
[01:52.00] The woman turns from the window, her eyes locking with his. A slow, knowing smile spreads across her face. All his reasons to resist have crumbled. [Camera: Dramatic zoom-in on her face]
[01:59.00] He gets up and walks towards her, his movements slow, deliberate, as if being pulled by an invisible string. He is a willing prisoner. [Camera: Tracking shot, following the man as he approaches her]
[02:06.00] She wraps her arms around his neck, her hands tangling in his hair. The embrace is both a comfort and a cage. [Camera: Close-up on the embrace, focusing on the intertwining of their hands and arms]
[02:13.00] A shot of the city from above, sprawling and indifferent. The lights glitter like a million broken promises. This is the world where their wildness can thrive. [Camera: Drone shot, high above the city, looking straight down]
[02:20.00] In the apartment, they are a tangle of limbs on a dark velvet couch. The scene is painterly, like a dark baroque masterpiece. Skin and shadow. [Camera: Dutch angle, medium shot, creating a sense of beautiful unease]
[02:28.00] A close-up on the man's shoulder, where the faint marks of her nails are visible. A beautiful bruise, a mark of ownership. [Camera: Macro shot, artistic and symbolic]
[02:35.00] He whispers something against her skin, his eyes closed. He is completely surrendered, made whole in the act of falling apart. [Camera: Intimate close-up, shallow depth of field]
[02:42.00] She holds his face in her hands, her gaze intense and unwavering. She is his beginning and his end. There is no escape, and he doesn't want one. [Camera: Two-shot, faces filling the frame, intense eye contact]
[02:49.00] The final shot is of them by the window again, but this time they are together, a single silhouette against the dawn sky. The storm has passed, leaving a beautiful, devastating calm. [Camera: Static wide shot, holding on their silhouette as the song fades]
[02:56.00] The screen cuts to black. The words "Pull me under" appear in a stark, white font, then fade. [Camera: Graphic]
