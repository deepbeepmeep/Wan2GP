<b>Wan2.1 GP by DeepBeepMeep based on Wan2.1's Alibaba: Open and Advanced Large-Scale Video Generative Models for the GPU Poor</b>
</p>

In this repository, we present **Wan2.1**, a comprehensive and open suite of video foundation models that pushes the boundaries of video generation. **Wan2.1** offers these key features:
- 👍 **SOTA Performance**: **Wan2.1** consistently outperforms existing open-source models and state-of-the-art commercial solutions across multiple benchmarks.
- 👍 **Supports Consumer-grade GPUs**: The T2V-1.3B model requires only 8.19 GB VRAM, making it compatible with almost all consumer-grade GPUs. It can generate a 5-second 480P video on an RTX 4090 in about 4 minutes (without optimization techniques like quantization). Its performance is even comparable to some closed-source models.
- 👍 **Multiple Tasks**: **Wan2.1** excels in Text-to-Video, Image-to-Video, Video Editing, Text-to-Image, and Video-to-Audio, advancing the field of video generation.
- 👍 **Visual Text Generation**: **Wan2.1** is the first video model capable of generating both Chinese and English text, featuring robust text generation that enhances its practical applications.
- 👍 **Powerful Video VAE**: **Wan-VAE** delivers exceptional efficiency and performance, encoding and decoding 1080P videos of any length while preserving temporal information, making it an ideal foundation for video and image generation.

## Features
*GPU Poor version by **DeepBeepMeep**. This great video generator can now run smoothly on any GPU.*

This version has the following improvements over the original Alibaba model:
- Reduce greatly the RAM requirements and VRAM requirements 
- Much faster thanks to compilation and fast loading / unloading
- Multiple profiles in order to able to run the model at a decent speed on a low end consumer config (32 GB of RAM and 12 VRAM) and to run it at a very good speed on a high end consumer config (48 GB of RAM and 24 GB of VRAM)
- Autodownloading of the needed model files
- Improved gradio interface with progression bar and more options
- Multiples prompts / multiple generations per prompt
- Support multiple pretrained Loras with 32 GB of RAM or less
- Much simpler installation


This fork by DeepBeepMeep is an integration of the mmpg module on the original model

It is an illustration on how one can set up on an existing model some fast and properly working CPU offloading with changing only a few lines of code in the core model.

## Installation Guide for Linux and Windows


This app has been tested on Python 3.10 / 2.6.0  / Cuda 12.4.\


```shell
# 0 Create a Python 3.10.9 environment or a venv using python
conda create -name Wan2GP python==3.10.9  #if you have conda

# 1 Install pytorch 2.6.0
pip install torch==2.6.0 torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/test/cu124  

# 2. Install pip dependencies
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3.1 optional Sage attention support (30% faster, easy to install on Linux but much harder on Windows)
python -m pip install sageattention==1.0.6 

# or for Sage Attention 2 (40% faster, sorry only manual compilation for the moment)
git pull https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention
cd sageattention 
pip install -e .

# 3.2 optional Flash attention support (easy to install on Linux but much harder on Windows)
python -m pip install flash-attn==2.7.2.post1

```

Note pytorch *sdpa attention* is available by default. It is worth installing *Sage attention* (albout not as simple as it sounds) because it offers a 30% speed boost over *sdpa attention* at a small quality cost.
In order to install Sage, you will need to install also Triton. If Triton is installed you can turn on *Pytorch Compilation* which will give you an additional 20% speed boost and reduced VRAM consumption.

### Ready to use python wheels for Windows users
I provide here links to simplify the installation for Windows users with Python 3.10 / Pytorch 2.51 / Cuda 12.4. I won't be able to provide support neither guarantee they do what they should do.
- Triton attention (needed for *pytorch compilation* and *Sage attention*)
```
pip install https://github.com/woct0rdho/triton-windows/releases/download/v3.2.0-windows.post9/triton-3.2.0-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl # triton for pytorch 2.6.0
```

- Sage attention
```
pip install https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/SageAttention/raw/refs/heads/main/releases/sageattention-2.1.0-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl # for pytorch 2.6.0 (experimental, if it works, otherwise you you will need to install and compile manually, see above) 
 
```

## Run the application

### Run a Gradio Server on port 7860 (recommended)

To run the text to video generator (in Low VRAM mode): 
```bash
python gradio_server.py
#or
python gradio_server.py --t2v

```

To run the image to video generator (in Low VRAM mode): 
```bash
python gradio_server.py --i2v
```

Within the application you can configure which video generator will be launched without specifying a command line switch.

To run the application while loading entirely the diffusion model in VRAM (slightly faster but requires 24 GB of VRAM for a 8 bits quantized 14B model )
```bash
python gradio_server.py --profile 3
```
Please note that diffusion model of Wan2.1GP is extremely VRAM optimized and this will greatly benefit low VRAM systems since the diffusion / denoising step is the longest part of the generation process. However, the VAE encoder (at the beginning of a image 2 video process) and the VAE decoder (at the end of any video process) is still VRAM hungry after optimization and it will require temporarly 22 GB of VRAM for a 720p generation and 12 GB of VRAM for a 480p generation. Therefore if you have less than these numbers, you may experience slow downs at the beginning and at the end of the generation process due to pytorch VRAM offloading.


### Loras support

-- Ready to be used but theoretical as no lora for Wan have been released as of today. ---

Every lora stored in the subfoler 'loras' will be automatically loaded. You will be then able to activate / desactive any of them when running the application.

For each activated Lora, you may specify a *multiplier* that is one float number that corresponds to its weight (default is 1.0), alternatively you may specify a list of floats multipliers separated by a "," that gives the evolution of this Lora's multiplier over the steps. For instance let's assume there are 30 denoising steps and the multiplier is *0.9,0.8,0.7* then for the steps ranges 0-9, 10-19 and 20-29 the Lora multiplier will be respectively 0.9, 0.8 and 0.7.

You can edit, save or delete Loras presets (combinations of loras with their corresponding multipliers) directly from the gradio interface. Each preset, is a file with ".lset" extension stored in the loras directory and can be shared with other users

Then you can pre activate loras corresponding to a preset when launching the gradio server:
```bash
python gradio_server.py --lora-preset  mylorapreset.lset # where 'mylorapreset.lset' is a preset stored in the 'loras' folder
```

You will find prebuilt Loras on https://civitai.com/ or you will be able to build them with tools such as kohya or onetrainer.


### Command line parameters for Gradio Server
--i2v : launch the image to video generator\
--t2v : launch the text to video generator\
--quantize-transformer bool: (default True) : enable / disable on the fly transformer quantization\
--lora-dir path : Path of directory that contains Loras in diffusers / safetensor format\
--lora-preset preset : name of preset gile (without the extension) to preload
--verbose level : default (1) : level of information between 0 and 2\
--server-port portno : default (7860) : Gradio port no\
--server-name name : default (0.0.0.0) : Gradio server name\
--open-browser : open automatically Browser when launching Gradio Server\
--compile : turn on pytorch compilation\
--attention mode: force attention mode among, sdpa, flash, sage, sage2\
--profile no : default (4) : no of profile between 1 and 5

### Profiles (for power users only)
You can choose between 5 profiles, but two are really relevant here :
- LowRAM_HighVRAM  (3): loads entirely the model in VRAM, slightly faster, but less VRAM
- LowRAM_LowVRAM  (4): load only the part of the models that is needed, low VRAM and low RAM requirement but slightly slower
