# wan2gp-lora-info
Wan2GP plugin. Displays selected LoRAs Information in HTML with a refresh button.

### LoRA Info (Plugin)

If an old JSON file is found in the LoRA directories, it should be deleted.  
After activation, you can find it on the right side under **LoRA Info (Plugin)**.  
Use the **Update Lora List** button to list all LoRAs found in the directory.  
The **Show only Activated Loras** button lists only the active LoRAs currently in use.  
The plugin tries to download the **JSON** data from **Civitai** and load the information based on it.  
If **no JSON** is found, it creates an empty one that users can fill in manually.  
If some data is missing from the downloaded Civitai JSON, users can **edit the JSON** file to complete it.  
The **Trained words** and **File name:** texts can be clicked to automatically copy their contents.  
**A short video guide is also available for reference:**

If you find any bugs and fix them, I’d really appreciate it — I'm not a pro developer :D
