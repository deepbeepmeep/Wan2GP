## Installation

### Enable the Plugin

1. **Using Plugin Manager (Recommended)**:
   - Open Wan2GP and go to the "Plugin Manager" tab
   - Find "wan2gp-prompt-library" in the list
   - Check the box to enable it
   - Click "Save & Restart"

2. **Manual Configuration**:
   - Find your server config file (usually in the Wan2GP directory)
   - Add `"wan2gp-prompt-library"` to the `enabled_plugins` array:
   ```json
   {
     "enabled_plugins": [
       "wan2gp-prompt-library"
     ]
   }
   ```
   - Restart Wan2GP

## Usage

### Browsing Prompts

1. Click the "📚 Prompt Library" tab
2. Select a collection from the left panel
3. Use the search box or tag filters to find prompts
4. Click on a prompt card to select it

### Using a Prompt

When you click a prompt card, you have two options:

- **📝 Use Prompt Only**: Copies just the prompt text to the main generator
- **⚙️ Use with Settings**: Copies the prompt AND applies all saved settings (model, resolution, LoRAs, etc.)

If the prompt contains variables like `{location}`, you'll see a field to fill them in before use.

### Saving a Prompt

1. Generate a video with the settings you want
2. In the Prompt Library tab, expand "💾 Save Current Prompt to Library"
3. Enter a name and select a collection
4. Add tags (comma-separated) for easier searching
5. Check "Save current generation settings" if you want to capture model/resolution/LoRAs
6. Click "💾 Save to Library"

### Variable Substitution

Create reusable prompt templates with variables:

```
Cinematic drone shot of {location}, {time_of_day} lighting, 4K quality
```

When you use this prompt, you'll be asked to fill in values:
```
location=mountains, time_of_day=golden hour
```

### Managing Collections

- **Create**: Click "➕ New" in the Collections panel (requires manual JSON editing currently)
- **Delete**: Select a collection and click "🗑️ Delete"
- **Export**: Use the Import/Export section to save a collection as JSON
- **Import**: Upload a JSON file to add prompts from another collection

### Favorites

Click the ⭐ button to add/remove a prompt from your Favorites collection for quick access.

- Export your favorites regularly as backup

## Troubleshooting

**Plugin doesn't appear**: Make sure it's enabled in the server config or Plugin Manager

**Prompts not saving**: Check that `~/.wan2gp/` directory exists and is writable

**Variables not substituting**: Make sure you use the format `key=value, key2=value2` with commas between pairs
